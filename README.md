Favorite Top Ten Website

Details

10-25-23: Created the framework and initialized the repo. 10-26-23: Completed the Figma for the website. 10-27-23: Added all of the components, code, and stylizing to match the Figma, still missing the actual top 10. 10-28-23: Added and completed the top 10 for each person. Finalized.

Peer review: by Avery Hillstrom- The website layout is very neat and pleasantly styled! The images on the #1 spots are a little stretched, and some of the images feel slightly overly-stretched when switching to tablet mode. On Chris's page, the numbering could be larger/bolded to make the order of the ranking clearer. Besides these nitpicks, visually it looks great and everything runs with no errors- the navbar style even changes when switching to tablet mode. Love the lego brick icon in the navbar.
